SimCache
========

Cache Block Replacement Policy Simulator

There are two folders: SimCache-Py and SimCache-Java. The code do the same function, one is developed with Python, the other with Java.

I developed this code for my master thesis: http://fitmore.es/academic/master.html and you can use this code for whatever you want.
